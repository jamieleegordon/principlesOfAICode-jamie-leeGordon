1. Linear Regression: 
    - run HousingPrices.py 
    - (this will run both batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent)
    - Predicted House value for a district with a median income of $80,000 (this will be seen in the terminal once ran)
        - e.g 'Predicted House Value for MedInc = 8.0 (Batch): 4.1693486989270445' and 'Predicted House Value for MedInc = 8.0 (SGD): 4.1461058806758'
    - You will have to wait a bit for the graphs to generate (need to wait for iteration 990 on Stochastic gradient descent)
    - Regression lines and all prediction graphs will be generated at once, once stochastic gradient descent has finished processing 

2. Support Vector Machines (SVM):
    - run harDataset.py
    - will display the accuraces in the terminal and generate matices for all kernels
